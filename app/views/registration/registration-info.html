        <p>An NHS number is a 10 digit number, like 485 777 3456.</p>
        <p>You can find your NHS number by logging in to a GP online service or on any document the NHS has sent you, such as your:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>prescriptions</li>
          <li>test results</li>
          <li>hospital referral letters</li>
          <li>appointment letters</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ask your GP surgery for help if you can't find your NHS number.</p>
