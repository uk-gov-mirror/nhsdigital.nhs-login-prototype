    <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">What you need to do if you are not registered:</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Contact your GP surgery. If you can, contact them without visiting in person.</li>
        <li>Ask your GP surgery to register you for their online services.</li>
        <li>
          Tell your GP surgery that you need your registration details for their online services. The 3 details you need are:
          <ul class="nhsuk-u-margin-top-2">
            <li>Linkage Key (could be called Passphrase)</li>
            <li>O.D.S. Code (could be called Organisation Code or Practice I.D.)</li>
            <li>Account I.D.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When you have all 3 details, use your NHS login to access the <strong>NHS App</strong>. You can use the 3 registration details to prove who you are instead of sending a photo of your I.D.</li>
